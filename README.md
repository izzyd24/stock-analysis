# stock-analysis
Space to hold information from Module 2 VBA
## Background
In this project, we are helping Steve and his parents understand green energy stocks from 2017-2018. 
We are trying to measure the yearly return and total daily volume. 
Through VBA we are automating the process of looking through the 17/18' data. 
For this module challenge we have both the 'green stocks' and 'VBa_Challenge' files. The green stocks file is our inital output, whereas the second file uses refractoring to make the timing more efficient (moving away from nested for loops). 
Steve's parents are invested in DAQO (DQ stock). We want to compare this to our tickers and see if it is worth investing. 
For outputs, we have the ticker, total daily volume, and the return as a percentage with condotional formatting
