# stock-analysis
Space to hold information from Module 2 VBA
## Background
In this project, we are helping Steve and his parents understand green energy stocks from 2017-2018. 
We are trying to measure the yearly return and total daily volume. 
Through VBA we are automating the process of looking through the 17/18' data. 
For this module challenge we have both the 'green stocks' and 'VBa_Challenge' files. The green stocks file is our inital output, whereas the second file uses refractoring to make the timing more efficient (moving away from nested for loops). 
Steve's parents are invested in DAQO (DQ stock). We want to compare this to our tickers and see if it is worth investing. 
For outputs, we have the ticker, total daily volume, and the return as a percentage with condotional formatting 
## Results
By looking at both the stock outputs for 2017 and 2018; we see the following: 
Returns
* 2017 outpeformed 2018 for green stocks in positive (green marked) returns. 
* 2018 had a majority of green stocks in the negative percentage of returns (red marked).
* The DQ ticker peformed worse year over year, dropping from 200% positive returns in 17' to -63% in 18'
* Recommendation: Hold and see its value at 2019, but place a sell off option if Steve's parents inital investment drops below 20%. We may suggest to put their funds in a less volatile stock. 
Daily Volume
* If the DQ ticker showed high daily trading, we could rationalize holding on the investment. 
* Once again, due to its 2018 performance, we found that its daily trading volume had no positive impact on the -63% drop for the year. This stock in particular is very risky. 
## Comparing AllStockAnalysis vs Refactored Version
Although both have the same run output (different timing); we do notice the following:
